# Text-Summarization

This project explores using BART (Bidirectional and Autoregressive Transformer) for text summarization tasks.

Project Description:
BART is a powerful pre-trained model capable of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. This project focuses on its ability to generate summaries of text data.

How it Works -
*BART Architecture: BART leverages a Transformer model, adept at analyzing relationships between words in a sequence. This is essential for understanding the context and importance of information within text.
*Pre-training: Before specific task application, BART undergoes pre-training on a massive text corpus using denoising autoencoding. This equips the model with general language understanding.
*Fine-tuning: For text summarization, BART is further trained on datasets where each entry comprises a document and its corresponding summary. This refines the model's ability to identify key points and generate 
 summaries.

BART Summarization Process - 
*Input Text: The user provides the text to be summarized.
*Tokenization: The text is broken down into smaller units called tokens (usually words) using a tokenizer specific to BART's model.
*Encoding: The tokenized text is fed into BART's encoder, which analyzes relationships between tokens and captures the overall meaning.
*Decoding: The decoder utilizes the encoded information to generate a new sequence â€“ the summary. The model considers the encoded text and predicts the most likely word for the summary, one at a time.
*Output Summary: BART outputs a concise summary that captures the essential points of the original text.
